   - Real-world analogies for state management
   - Practice implementing state changes
   - Debug common state problems together

**Break (10 minutes)**

**Second Hour:**
2. Storage Implementation (50 minutes)
   - Implement local storage with TypeScript
   - Handle data persistence
   - Add error handling
   - Create a small project using both state and storage

### Session 3: Building Real Components
**First Hour:**
1. Counter Component (50 minutes)
   - Build from scratch together
   - Implement state management
   - Add storage persistence
   - Style with Tailwind CSS

**Break (10 minutes)**

**Second Hour:**

   - Multiple event handlers
   - Custom styling with Tailwind CSS
   - Real-time debugging and problem-solving

### Session 4: Advanced Topics and Project
**First Hour:**
1. Choose and Build a Custom Component (50 minutes)
   - Student picks a component to build
   - Mentor guides through implementation
   - Real-time code review and optimization
   - Add advanced features based on student's interests

**Break (10 minutes)**

**Second Hour:**
2. Code Review and Best Practices (50 minutes)
   - Review all components built
   - Optimize code together
   - Discuss potential improvements
   - Plan next steps for independent learning

## Teaching Approach
1. **Interactive Coding**
   - Student shares screen while coding
   - Mentor provides real-time feedback
   - Pause frequently for questions
   - Use debugging as a teaching tool

2. **Personalized Pace**
   - Adjust speed based on student's understanding
   - Deep dive into topics of particular interest
   - Skip or expand sections as needed
   - Additional challenges for quick learners

3. **Real-World Context**
   - Connect concepts to real job scenarios
   - Share professional best practices
   - Discuss common workplace challenges
   - Provide industry insights

## Progress Tracking
After each session:
1. Review key concepts learned
2. Identify areas needing more practice
3. Set small homework tasks
4. Plan focus areas for next session

## Common Adjustment Points
Be ready to spend extra time on:
1. TypeScript type system complexities
2. State management concepts
3. Component lifecycle understanding
4. Debugging techniques

## Extension Activities
Based on student interest:
1. Add unit tests
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts
3. Create animations
4. Add drag-and-drop functionality
5. Explore advanced TypeScript features

## Session Preparation
Before each session:
1. Review previous session's code
2. Prepare specific examples
3. Have backup exercises ready
4. Set up debugging scenarios

## Post-Course Support
1. Provide reference materials
2. Share recommended next steps
